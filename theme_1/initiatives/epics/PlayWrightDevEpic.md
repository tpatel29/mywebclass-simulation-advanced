# Epic: 
Develop and Perform Automated Testing with Playwright for Measuring Site Performance

## Description:
The goal of this epic is to develop and perform automated testing with Playwright to measure site performance in the browser. By measuring performance metrics and catching regressions early, we can ensure a better user experience and maintain site performance as features are added or changed.

## Goals:

Develop automated tests using Playwright to measure site performance metrics
Run automated tests on different environments to ensure consistent performance
Integrate automated tests into CI/CD pipeline to catch performance regressions early

## User Stories:

As a developer, I want to develop automated tests using Playwright to measure performance metrics, so that I can ensure consistent site performance.
As a QA, I want to run automated tests on different environments to ensure consistent performance, so that I can catch performance regressions early.
As a team member, I want to integrate automated tests into the CI/CD pipeline, so that we can ensure site performance as new features are added or changed.

## Dependencies:

Access to different environments for testing (e.g. local, staging, production)
Integration with CI/CD pipeline

## Risks:

Performance metrics may not accurately reflect user experience
Playwright library may not be compatible with certain web technologies
Automated tests may require updates as site changes

## Estimated Effort:

User Story 1: 5 story points
User Story 2: 3 story points
User Story 3: 2 story points

## Business Value:

Improved site performance through early detection of performance regressions
Increased confidence in site performance as features are added or changed
More efficient testing through automated tests

## Priority:

High
