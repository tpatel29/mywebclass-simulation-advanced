# User Story 1:
Develop automated tests using Playwright to measure performance metrics

## Description:
As a developer, I want to develop automated tests using Playwright to measure performance metrics, so that I can ensure consistent site performance.

## Acceptance Criteria:

Automated tests are developed using Playwright to measure performance metrics such as page load time, time to first byte, and time to interactive
Tests are designed to be run on different environments (e.g. local, staging, production)
Tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that they run automatically on every build
Performance metrics are logged and reported so that developers can track any changes over time
