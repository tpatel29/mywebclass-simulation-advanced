# User Story 2:
Run automated tests on different environments to ensure consistent performance

## Description:
As a QA, I want to run automated tests on different environments to ensure consistent performance, so that I can catch performance regressions early.

## Acceptance Criteria:

* Automated tests are run on different environments to ensure consistent performance (e.g. local, staging, production)
* Tests are run automatically on every build, and any performance regressions are caught early
* Test results are logged and reported so that the team can easily track performance changes over time
* Any performance regressions are escalated to the development team for investigation and resolution
