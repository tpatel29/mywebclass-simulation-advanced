# Epic: 
Implement a central deployment system for team members to view sprint progress

## Description:
This initiative involves setting up a deployment system that all team members can access to view the progress of the current sprint. The goal is to improve collaboration, communication, and overall efficiency by providing a central location for team members to view task progress and sprint updates.

## Goals:

* Improve team collaboration and communication
* Increase efficiency and productivity
* Provide real-time visibility into sprint progress
* Improve sprint planning and execution

## User Stories:

As a team member, I want to be able to access the deployment system so that I can view the progress of the current sprint.


As a team member, I want to be able to filter and search for specific tasks so that I can easily find relevant information.

As a team member, I want to be able to view a task's history and any associated comments so that I can understand its context and progress.


## Dependencies:

* Access to a cloud-based deployment service such as AWS or Azure
* Integration with the team's development workflow and sprint process

## Risks:

* Delays or issues with deployment setup could impact sprint progress
* Integration with development workflow may be more complex than anticipated
* Security vulnerabilities could arise if access control is not properly configured

## Estimated effort:

* Deployment setup and access permissions - 1 week
* Integration with development workflow - 2 weeks
* Automated testing and acceptance testing - 3 weeks

## Business Value:

* Improved collaboration and communication
* Increased efficiency and productivity
* Improved sprint planning and execution

## Priority:

High, as this initiative will significantly improve the team's ability to plan and execute sprints efficiently.
