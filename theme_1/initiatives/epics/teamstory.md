# User Story 3:
Integrate automated tests into the CI/CD pipeline

## Description: 
As a team member, I want to integrate automated tests into the CI/CD pipeline, so that we can ensure site performance as new features are added or changed.

## Acceptance Criteria:

* Automated tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline and run automatically on every build
* Any performance regressions are caught early and logged for investigation
* The development team is alerted to any performance regressions so that they can be resolved quickly
* Performance metrics are logged and reported so that the team can easily track performance changes over time.
