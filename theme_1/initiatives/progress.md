# Progress Inititive

## Test Plan:

* Manual testing of the deployment setup and access permissions for all team members
* Automated testing of the deployment to ensure reliability and accuracy
* Integration testing with the development workflow and sprint process
* Acceptance testing with the team to ensure the deployment meets their needs and expectations

## Description:
The initiative is to set up a deployment that all members of the team can access to view the progress of the sprint. The deployment will include information such as the current sprint status, task progress, and any updates or changes made during the sprint. The goal is to provide a central location for the team to view the progress of the sprint and ensure everyone is on the same page.

## Scope:
The deployment will be set up using a cloud-based service such as AWS or Azure, and access will be granted to all members of the team. The deployment will be integrated into the team's development workflow and sprint process, with regular updates and notifications provided.

## Goals:

* Provide a central location for the team to view the progress of the sprint
* Ensure all team members are up-to-date on task progress and any changes made during the sprint
* Increase collaboration and communication among team members
* Improve overall efficiency and productivity

## Outcomes:

* A deployment setup that all members of the team can access to view the progress of the sprint
* Improved collaboration and communication among team members
* Increased efficiency and productivity
* Improved sprint planning and execution

## Deliverables:

* A cloud-based deployment setup with access granted to all team members
* Documentation outlining how to access and use the deployment
* Automated tests for the deployment
* Integration with the team's development workflow and sprint process

## Milestones:

* Setup deployment and access permissions - 1 week
* Integration with development workflow - 2 weeks
* Automated testing and acceptance testing - 3 weeks

## Constraints:

* Budget and resource constraints may limit the choice of cloud-based service
* The deployment must meet security and access control requirements

## Assumptions:

* All team members have access to the cloud-based service chosen for the deployment
* The team is already using an established development workflow and sprint process
* The deployment will be updated regularly to reflect sprint progress

## Risks:

* Delays or issues with setting up the deployment could impact sprint progress and efficiency
* Integration with the development workflow may be more complex than anticipated
* Security vulnerabilities could arise if access control is not properly configured

## Dependencies:

* Access to a cloud-based service for the deployment setup
* Availability of team members to participate in acceptance testing

## Team:

* Product Owner
* Scrum Master
* Developers
* QA Engineer
* Technical Writer
