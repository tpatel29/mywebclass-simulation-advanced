# Agile Initiative: 
Develop and Perform Automated Testing with Playwright for Measuring Site Performance

## Test Plan:

Define performance metrics to measure (e.g. page load time, first contentful paint, time to interactive, etc.)
Develop automated tests using Playwright to simulate user interactions and measure performance metrics
Run automated tests on different environments (e.g. local, staging, production) to ensure consistent performance
Integrate automated tests into CI/CD pipeline to catch performance regressions early

## Description:
The goal of this initiative is to develop and perform automated testing with Playwright to measure site performance in the browser. By measuring performance metrics and catching regressions early, we can ensure a better user experience and maintain site performance as features are added or changed.

## Scope:
This initiative will cover the development of automated tests using Playwright to measure performance metrics for the entire site or specific pages. The tests will be run on different environments to ensure consistent performance, and will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to catch performance regressions early.

## Goals:

Develop automated tests using Playwright to measure site performance metrics
Run automated tests on different environments to ensure consistent performance
Integrate automated tests into CI/CD pipeline to catch performance regressions early

## Outcomes:

Improved site performance through early detection of performance regressions
Increased confidence in site performance as features are added or changed
More efficient testing through automated tests

## Deliverables:

Automated tests using Playwright to measure performance metrics
Documentation on how to run and interpret the tests
Integration of automated tests into CI/CD pipeline

## Milestones:

Development of automated tests for measuring performance metrics (2 weeks)
Testing of automated tests on different environments (1 week)
Integration of automated tests into CI/CD pipeline (1 week)

## Constraints:

Limited resources (e.g. time, budget)
Dependence on Playwright library for automated testing

## Assumptions:

Development team has knowledge of JavaScript and Playwright library
Site has been built with web technologies that are compatible with Playwright

## Risks:

Performance metrics may not accurately reflect user experience
Playwright library may not be compatible with certain web technologies
Automated tests may require updates as site changes

## Dependencies:

Access to different environments for testing (e.g. local, staging, production)
Integration with CI/CD pipeline

## Team:

Product Owner
Scrum Master
Developers (responsible for developing automated tests using Playwright)
QA (responsible for running and interpreting automated tests)
