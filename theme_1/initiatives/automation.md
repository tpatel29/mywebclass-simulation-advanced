*  [Epic 1](epics/epic1.md)

## Test Plan:

Create a test plan that includes testing the deployment times of each website built with npm, yarn, and pnpm.
The test plan should also include identifying any bottlenecks in the deployment process and testing possible solutions to improve deployment times.

## Description:

This initiative aims to measure and improve deployment times for websites built with different front-end frameworks and build tools.
By identifying and resolving any bottlenecks in the deployment process, we can streamline our development process and improve overall efficiency.

## Scope:

The initiative will focus on building three websites with Bootstrap, Tailwind, and Bulma using npm, yarn, and pnpm.
The scope will include measuring deployment times for each website and identifying any issues that may affect deployment times.
The scope will also include researching and testing possible solutions to improve deployment times.

## Goals:

To measure deployment times for each website and identify any bottlenecks in the deployment process.
To research and test possible solutions to improve deployment times.
To implement measurable improvements to deployment times for each website.

## Outcomes:

Improved deployment times for each website.
Streamlined development process.
Increased efficiency and productivity.

## Deliverables:

Deployment time measurements for each website.
A report outlining any bottlenecks in the deployment process and possible solutions to improve deployment times.
Implemented solutions to improve deployment times.
A final report detailing the improvements made and the impact on the development process.

## Milestones:

Milestone 1: Build the three websites with Bootstrap, Tailwind, and Bulma using npm, yarn, and pnpm. (2 weeks)
Milestone 2: Measure deployment times for each website and identify any bottlenecks. (1 week)
Milestone 3: Research and test possible solutions to improve deployment times. (2 weeks)
Milestone 4: Implement solutions to improve deployment times. (2 weeks)
Milestone 5: Final report detailing improvements made and impact on the development process. (1 week)

## Constraints:

Limited budget for testing tools and resources.
Limited team resources.

## Assumptions:

All team members have experience building websites with Bootstrap, Tailwind, and Bulma using npm, yarn, and pnpm.
All team members have the necessary resources and tools to conduct testing and research.

## Risks:

Possible delays in the development process due to unforeseen issues or complications.
Limited budget and resources may affect the quality of testing and research.

## Dependencies:

Availability of necessary resources and tools for testing and research.
Availability of team members for testing and research.
